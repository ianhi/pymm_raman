# pymm_raman

Tools for collecting Raman spectrum while running MDAs using [pymmcore-plus](https://github.com/tlambert03/pymmcore-plus#pymmcore-plus)

This is even more pre-alpha than pymmcore-plus so probably not something you should be using. However, if python control of a Raman spectroscopy system on a traditional fluoresence microscope is of interest to you then I'd love to talk to you about what you're working on. Get in contact with me via the information here: https://ianhi.github.io/contact/ or an issue here.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ianhi/pymm_raman
